            Zack Lewin is a takatāpui multidisciplinary creative based in Naarm Melbourne. Specialising in transmedia and digital dramaturgies, Zack strives for storytelling which bends reality, builds lore, and immerses audiences in robust other worlds; both strange and familiar.

For the past 4 years, Zack has represented young creatives and audiences as the youngest board member, and now secretary, of Shopfront Arts Co-op.

Zack primarily works as a new writing dramaturg, collaborating with writers on the creation of new plays with distinctly Oceanic voices. Such works include Bruntwood Prize winning <i>红铅 The Red Lead</i> by Roshelle Fong, <i>Werkaholics</i> by Vivian Nguyen, and <i>Fekei</i> by Sarah Carroll.

In 2023, Zack completed his Master of Theatre (Dramaturgy) with first class honours and completed a hospitanz at the Schaubühne in Berlin, shadowing resident dramaturg Nils Haarmann and working on projects by Yana Thönnes, Katie Mitchell and Falk Richter. While this experience was extraordinary, it cemented Zack's earnest commitment to Oceanic voices.
