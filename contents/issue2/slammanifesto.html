       <p><i>Editor's Note:</i></p>
             <p><i>Explosives Factory is my least favourite theatre, EVER. It’s Melbourne’s limbo for the overflow of Theatreworks’ notoriously over-programmed seasons. Artists “lucky” enough to be programmed there need to fight extra hard to get audiences to want to journey into the armpit of St Kilda. The makers of SLAY achieved this. An extensive marketing campaign kept SLAY at the forefront of my mind for months even though, frankly, I was mid crash out, partying and neglecting my worldly obligations in favour of an uncharacteristically hedonistic summer. I don’t think I saw any other play that summer, but SLAY. </i></p>
             <p><i>It was a few months after the most hateful and exclusionary political campaign of my lifetime successfully seized control of the United States of America. And just a few short months before an election of our own. The audience was frightened about what the future could be. How easy it is for bad actors to use the internet to exploit the limitations of our colonial “democracies.” SLAY said, let’s just be gay and have fun with that shit. A satirical celebration of now, in all of its grotesquerie. </i></p>
       
        <heading><b>PART A – KEY IDEOLOGIES OF <i>SLAM</i></b></heading>


        <p>The patriarchy is the disintegration of the human race. It is a stain on universal ideals of democracy. For the human race to survive, the world needs to be led by all but cis men (ABCMs), specifically lesbians. </p>
        <p>The perpetuation of patriarchal values by cis-men has significantly contributed to systemic inequalities and societal dysfunction. It is time for a complete revolution of society.</p>
        <p>Cis-men claim that their biological physical strength makes them better suited for leadership and positions of power. It is precisely cis-men’s strength that makes them unfit for office. </p>
        <p>We call it the big muscle, small brain phenomenon. It is time ABCMs are encouraged and given space to flourish in their creative and meaningful pursuits while cis-men utilise their biological physical strength to work on the menial, manual labour tasks that are imperative to a well-functioning society.
        </p>
        <p>As the great poet Sappho said: Cis-men are like jellyfish, while ABCMs are like dolphins. Cis-men float aimlessly through life, wandering and purposeless, whereas ABCMs leap forward with great majesty and internal strength. </p>
        <p>SLAM knows that cis-men need to be led; they crave a dominant, powerful, commanding ABCM to drive them. Their greatest need is to be nurtured, loved, sheltered, and appreciated by Mother. 
        </p>
        <p>Moreover, we know that cis-men are prone to emotional outbursts of rage due to their chronic lack of empathy and stunted emotional growth. These tendencies raise important questions about emotional regulation and decision-making in leadership roles. Their predisposed biological inability to self-regulate and make sound decisions ultimately makes them unfit to rule companies, let alone governments. What if he is triggered by a small disagreement and decides to start a nuclear war? Studies indicate that emotional intelligence plays a significant role in conflict resolution and long-term strategic thinking, suggesting that only ABCMs have the required abilities to lead.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <heading><b>PART B – ACTIONS REQUIRED</b></heading>
        <p>In order for SLAM to succeed and thrive we need to: educate, proliferate and overtake.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>PILLAR I: EDUCATION</b></p>
        <p>Education is the first most important pillar of SLAM. It is imperative to the survival of a just democracy that education be the guiding force of our current generation and the ones to come, starting from as early as four years old, all the way to higher learning level. In the age of online misinformation and a reversion to archaic, patriarchal modes of existence, a lack of formalised education on the historical downfalls of cis-men threatens the interconnected truth telling of ABCMs’ struggles globally. Through educating ABCMs and the future generation, we can show them the horrifying reality we are subjected to, and encourage them to break free from the societal shackles that keep them oppressed under patriarchy.</p>
        <p>Formalised education on SLAM’s principles demands the rejection of rhetoric that undermines SLAM to allow for complete liberation of the mind, body and soul from the cis-man’s control of current society. A commitment to education involves surrounding oneself with individuals who actively support the pursuit of justice and equality and the complete removal of oneself from the company of those who do not engage and share in SLAM’s values, family and friends included. While this may prove a challenging process, it is a necessary step toward intellectual liberation and societal transformation from the claws of cis-men.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>PILLAR II: PROLIFERATION</b></p>
        <p>SLAM has several strategies to ensure its proliferation. Our mission is clear: to expose the lies perpetuated by cis-men and to empower those who have been denied their voice. This includes the dissemination of SLAM principles across key online platforms to ensure our influence is accessible to all, especially ABCMs across lines of class, race and creed, ignite conversations, and promote the circulation, reposting, and amplification of SLAM’s message. Every post, every comment, every share, every conversation is a strike against the systems that seek to silence us. </p>
        <p>We do not confine ourselves to digital spaces. We see the importance of protest and taking our message to the streets around the world in order to maximise visibility and further share our educational messaging. Our protests are not just acts of defiance but declarations of existence. Through direct action, we claim public space and confront the structures that uphold oppression. The world will see us. The world will hear us.</p>
        <p>Community engagement is the key to SLAM’s existence. We establish local chapters, autonomous yet united, where those aligned with SLAM’s principles come together to foster radical change. These are spaces of education, resistance, and solidarity, where leadership is collective and non-hierarchical. We do not replicate the power structures we resist—we dismantle them. Here, every voice carries weight, and every individual has the opportunity to lead.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>PILLAR III: OVERTAKING THE GOVERNMENT</b></p>
        <p>SLAM must overtake the government entirely. This is the inevitable path of a truly just and equitable society of ABBCMs, regardless of the length and difficulty of the process. When it comes to liberation, tenacity is nothing short of non-negotiable; a necessity in the face of structural insecurities that perpetually place non-men at the lowest rungs of society. No action is too drastic. Only once SLAM overtakes the government can true action and process begin towards realising our ideal society of ABCMs in positions of merit and power.
            The current systems of governance that uphold patriarchy and structural oppression are beyond reform. For too long, cis-men have controlled the levers of power, shaping societies built on inequality, exploitation, and exclusion. Their rule has not been just—it has been self-serving. Their policies have not fostered equity—they have reinforced division. Their leadership has not been based on respect—it has demanded submission. This era must end.
            We will replace these failed systems with a new order—one founded on justice, equity, and respect. A society where ABCMs are no longer pushed to the margins but are centred as the architects of a better world. Our path to overtaking the state will be strategic, relentless, and collective.
            </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <heading><b>PART C – THE IDEAL SOCIETY</b></heading>
        <br>
        <p><b>PILLAR I: THE SOCIOECONOMIC ORDER OF THE IDEAL SOCIETY</b></p>
        <p>Society will only be fixed once SLAM has achieved its actions and assumed absolute and total control over the running of the government. In this envisioned society, financial and institutional power will be placed exclusively in the hands of Lesbians. Given their intrinsic capacity for ethical governance, Lesbians alone possess the foresight and moral imperative to act in the best interests of every ABCM. Through this restructuring, economic systems will be recalibrated to dismantle patriarchal monopolies and redistribute resources equitably.
        </p>
        <p>In alignment with our commitment to bodily autonomy and the eradication of gendered economic disparity, all menstrual and transition-related medical expenses will be state-funded, with essential items such as pads, tampons, menstrual cups and strap-ons rendered tax-exempt. Healthcare must be universally accessible, and SLAM asserts that true autonomy is only possible when financial barriers to self-determination are permanently abolished.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>PILLAR II: RE-DEFINING GENDERED LABOUR AND POPULATION DISTRIBUTION</b></p>
        <p>Given the negligible role of cis-men within this reconstructed order, their population shall be ethically and sustainably maintained at a maximum threshold of 10% of the total human population. Their primary societal function will be confined to sperm production and the execution of physically intensive labour essential to infrastructure and communal welfare. The era of unchecked cis-male dominance is at an end; in its place, a system of accountability and redistributive justice shall emerge.</p>
        <p>In the ideal society heterosexual marriages will be illegal. We hold strong in our belief that heterosexual intercourse is the pure, formalised expression of contempt for the body. We do not understand it to be treating your body like a temple.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>PILLAR III: SPECIFIC ACTIONS REQUIRED</b></p>
        <br>
        <p><b><i>1. COMMUNITY MOBILIZATION & CHAPTER BUILDING</i></b></p>
        <p>We are fostering a global network of SLAM chapters—autonomous yet united—where people organize, educate, and take action. These spaces will empower ABCMs to reclaim political agency, create alternative systems of governance, and establish self-sustaining communities outside patriarchal control.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b><i>2. DISRUPTING POWER STRUCTURES</i></b></p>
        <p>The systems that uphold cis-male dominance must be actively confronted. Through protests, direct action, and mass mobilisation. We will challenge institutions at every level—political, economic, and cultural—until they can no longer function under their existing patriarchal frameworks.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b><i>3. STRATEGIC INFILTRATION & POLICY RECLAMATION</i></b></p>
        <P>SLAM will place our people in key positions of influence—within legal, educational, and economic institutions—to disrupt, subvert, and repurpose them for justice. Where we cannot reform, we will dismantle. Where we cannot dismantle, we will build alternatives that render the old systems obsolete.
        </P>
        <br>
        <p><b><i>4. RADICAL EDUCATION & MASS AWAKENING</i></b></p>
        <p>We will unmask the lies that have kept cis-men in power and awaken those still trapped within them. Through media, grassroots education, and cultural interventions, we will spread the truth: the patriarchy is not natural, it is not inevitable, and it will not last. A just society is possible, and it requires the leadership of those who have long been denied power.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><b><i>5. SELF-SUSTAINING GOVERNANCE & NON-HIERARCHICAL LEADERSHIP</i></b></p>
        <p>SLAM does not seek to replace one ruling class with another. Our movement is non-hierarchical, built on collective leadership and mutual respect. We are not here to replicate power—we are here to redistribute it. Through direct democracy, cooperative economies, and intersectional justice frameworks, we will establish new systems that serve the many, not the few.</p>
        <br>
              <p>This ideal society is a complete renewal and will allow ABCMs to flourish as they rightfully deserve under the guidance of SLAM Lesbians that have spent years educating themselves and fighting for the society we deserve. 
            </p>
              <p>This is not a dream. This is the future. The current order is collapsing, and we are building the foundations of what comes next. The time for half-measures is over. The time for action is now.
                SLAM will not be ignored. SLAM will not be stopped. SLAM will take power—and with it, we will create a just world.
                </p>
              <p>We are SLAM - the Society of Lesbians Against (cis)Men. </p>
