    <content>
        <p>[CHARACTER] Actor to play a Female, 18-24, [ETHNICITY]. This is, of course, merely a suggestion and may be avoided, glanced over, or ignored at the casting director's* discretion.
        <br><br>
            *(The casting director is white.)</p>
        <br>
        <p>You must be pale enough to appease white audiences (subscribers) AND dark enough to appease POC (future subscribers *fingers crossed emoji (white)*)</p>
        <br>
        <p>Importantly, in the event you are cast (unlikely), you must have the correct level of ethnic ambiguity** to appease other unsuccessful auditioners.<br>**(a.k.a beauty of the <i>eurocentric</i> variety. *** )
            <br><br>
            ***(specifically: your skin must be dark enough that it is reasonable to question if that is your true skin colour, or if you have engaged in doping via using fake tan.)</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>You must be able to appropriately and decisively remind your peers that we are still seeking a role for the white gaze [CORRECTION:] our subscriber-base, and therefore NOT them. This is due to our artistic director's belief that audiences don't want to see diversity**** on stage, only that they want to believe that they have seen it.
        </p>
        <p>
            ****(specifically: we do not believe audiences are willing to pay as high prices for shows which authentically represent people of colour and their stories, therefore we will perform as though we are <i>authentically</i>***** representing people of colour and their stories.) 
           </p>
        <p>
            *****(<i>inauthentically</i>)
        </p>
        <p>Note: Due to budget constraints, we are limited to black stage curtains which you may blend into. If you are darker than this, you will not be considered.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We are not seeking culturally correct performers for this role at the moment. In your email please include what races you have been mistaken for, played a guessing game for and or pretended to be for previous roles on your resume.</p>
        <br>
        <p>At the moment, mixed race people are unfortunately not seen as being culturally ambiguous enough for this role and its requirements.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Note: However, if you are mixed race with up to one or more white parents, this may in fact increase your chances for consideration.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Note: Auditioners with an ethnic-sounding name will be preferred, ideally a name that can be charmingly shortened into something that sounds a bit more nemei [CORRECTION:] cute.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Note: In fact, auditioners with an ethnic sounding middle name but a nermal [CORRECTION:] pronounceable first name will be preferred.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Note: If you are... white... you can still audition! We don't want you to feel excluded.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Finally, all performers must be public about their experience of their cultural identity.</p>
        <br>
        <p>They must make available to us:</p>
    <ul class="checklist">
        <li><input type="checkbox"> Their race</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> Their ethnicity</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> Their cultural history</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> Their clans</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> Their villages</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> Their ancestors</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> Their songs</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> Their dances</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> Their greetings</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> Their storytelling</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> Their recipes</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> Their clothing</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> Their jewellery</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> Their accessories</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> Their ability to speak (or not speak) the language of their parent(s)</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> Their journey of self discovery</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> Their journey of cultural discovery</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> Their personal experience of racism</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> Their deeply personal relationship with their body</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> Their lived experience of being themself</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>All performers must make the above listed deeply personal lived experiences readily available for the casting director to mine for potential value to the dramaturgical systems of the work and public relations of our company.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Remember, if you are not willing to do this, someone else will be.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Note: This is an UNPAID gig.</p>
    <br>
    <centre>No Acting Experience Required. :)******</centre>
    <br>
    <p>******However, only experienced performers who hold a degree from NIDA, VCA or WAAPA will be considered.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If this sounds like a role you, or someone you know, might be right for, please email a recent photo (altered accepted) and tell us your name and where you are based.<br><a href="mailto:orangutanmagazine@gmail.com">orangutanmagazine@gmail.com</a></p>
    <br>
    <p>We are committed to diverse, inclusive casting. Submission for non-descript roles will be accepted for all performers, regardless of age, sex, ethnicity, disability, race, colour, national origin, sexual orientation or gender identity or any other basis prohibited by law, subject to legitimate casting objectives.</p>
