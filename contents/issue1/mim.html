        <h4>SUSPECT: MARCUS “IAN” MCKENZIE</h4>
        <br>
        <div class="scene">
        It is a gloomy room, a sage green colour with strange drip marks adorning the walls... what liquid could have formed those drips... could it be... bLOOD!l?<br>
        Marcus Ian McKenzie (37) is tied with bright orange rope to an office chair in the middle of the room, he can spin around but cannot move his body. He is harshly lit with white lights.<br>
        Zack is conducting the interrogation, Grace is there for moral support as well as physical intimidation of the suspect, she bucks at him often.<br>
        Marcus sweats bullets, knowing the jig may be up.

        <br>
        <div class="character">M</div>
        <div class="dialogue-M">Marcus Ian McKenzie.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="character">Z</div>
        <div class="dialogue-Z">Got it, <i>Marcuuus Mckeen/z</i>.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="character">M</div>
        <div class="dialogue-M">Oh sorry, Marcus Ian McKenzie.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="character">Z</div>
        <div class="dialogue-Z">That's how you want to be billed?</div>
        <br>
        <div class="character">M</div>
        <div class="dialogue-M">Yeah... "Marcus McKenzie" is a semi-successful filmmaker from Adelaide, whereas "Marcus Ian McKenzie" is like... an artist. From Melbourne. More of like, like a real artist's kinda artist you know? Also, the Adelaide guy owns marcusmckenzie.com so I had to rebrand.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="character">Z</div>
        <div class="dialogue-Z">So that's your occupation? For the record? A real artist's kinda artist?</div>
        <br>
        <div class="character">M</div>
        <div class="dialogue-M">Actually, I call myself an <i>acteur</i>, which I think playfully highlights my interest in language-mangling and wordbuilding (sic).</div>
        <br>
        <div class="character">Z</div>
        <div class="dialogue-Z">And who would you consider your most frequent collaborators?</div>
        <br>
        <div class="character">M</div>
        <div class="dialogue-M">Some people I work with regularly are Harriet Gillies & Thom Smyth from Sydney; while here in Naarm I have been working a lot with Anna Nalpantidis, D Duàn, Nina Buchanon and Romanie Harper. Lately, I've also done more club-based stuff with Soft Centre, Miscellania, Lucid Danceclub, Room2, Le Fag and MONA. Oh! and I also do puppet theatre for children aged 7-13.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="character">Z</div>
        <div class="dialogue-Z">Tell us, Marcus "Ian" McKenzie, why did you hold myself and my friend/collaborator, Grace Ellen Macpherso/n -</div>
        <br>
        <div class="character">M</div>
        <div class="dialogue-M">Grace "Ellen" Macpherson.*</div>
        <br>
        <div class="character">Z</div>
        <div class="dialogue-Z">Huh?</div>
        <br>
        <div class="character">M</div>
        <div class="dialogue-M">If you're gonna put quotations around my middle name I want them around hers too.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="character">Z</div>
        <div class="dialogue-Z">Oh! You would exercise micro-managerial control over us wouldn't you? Just like you did when we were your unpaid interns on your Green Room-award-winning durational performance work <b>8/8/8:WORK</b> which <b>WE KNOW</b> you made in collaboration with Harriet Gillies!</div>
        <br>
        <div class="scene">
        *Grace bucks at Marcus and makes a scary face*
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="character">M</div>
        <div class="dialogue-M">For the record, we abused you as unpaid interns to make a point. It was a joke.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="character">Z</div>
        <div class="dialogue-Z">Some kind of sick millennial joke</div>
        <br>
        <div class="character">M</div>
        <div class="dialogue-M">I think if there's room, in the interview that is, it could be good to have a little more context about your experience on <b>8/8/8:WORK</b> for people who don't know the project.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="character">Z</div>
        <div class="dialogue-Z">So that's what this interrogation is to you then!? An interview!? Yet another opportunity for you to market your 3-part series of 8-hour-long durational works. Including: <b>8/8/8:WORK</b> which debuted in RISING festival 2022. A commentary on the 8 hour work day within which Grace and I inter/ned -</div>
        <br>
        <div class="character">G</div>
        <div class="dialogue-G">And were made to shave your naked body!</div>
        <br>
        <div class="character">Z</div>
        <div class="dialogue-Z">Yeah that!</div>
        <br>
        <div class="character">M</div>
        <div class="dialogue-M">Listen... it was a different time. It was the wild west back then! You just.. you just can't do anything anym/ore.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="character">Z</div>
        <div class="dialogue-Z">Well apparently we didn't shave it good enough, because we certainly were <b>NOT</b> invited back to part 2, <b>8/8/8:REST</b>, which debuted at RISING Festival 2024 and served to highlight the insufficiency of only 8 hours of rest in the 40 -hour-work week economic model which we have inherited.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="character">M</div>
        <div class="dialogue-M">We had a much smaller budget.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="character">G</div>
        <div class="dialogue-G">So you cut the unpaid interns? You disgust me...</div>
        <br>
        <div class="scene">
        *Grace spits on Marcus*
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="character">M</div>
        <div class="dialogue-M">So you're disgusted by work of scale!?</div>
        <br>
        <div class="character">Z</div>
        <div class="dialogue-Z">And what exactly would you consider "work of scale"? What makes it different from ordinary shit?</div>
        <br>
        <div class="character">M</div>
        <div class="dialogue-M">I guess it just means a big project with lots of moving parts, lots of collaborators, lots of logistics. It's not my term, I heard some arts bureaucrat use it once. It's only different to other shit in terms of kind, not quality. Like size doesn't matter - you can make something ambitious and microscopic, or gigantic and myopic. There's no hierarchy there, it's just sometimes helpful to use specific langu/age.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="character">G</div>
        <div class="dialogue-G">Ok shut up now. It's our turn to do the talking.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="scene">
        *Grace bucks at Marcus once again and makes an even scarier face*
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="character">Z</div>
        <div class="dialogue-Z">Thank you Grace. So, Marcus, one night after a long and grueling day of unpaid labour, which we donated to <b>8/8/8:WORK</b>, Grace and I rushed off the tram in a tizzy! We had forgotten my laptop. We had to walk up Sydney road, back to Schoolhouse Studios... and then we saw it.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="character">M</div>
        <div class="dialogue-M">Your laptop?</div>

        <div class="character">G</div>
        <div class="dialogue-G"><b>NO!</b> We saw It!!!! You!! There!! Surrounded by bodies flying in circles around you as you glowed!</div>
        <br>
        <div class="character">M</div>
        <div class="dialogue-M">I do have a glow about me, but I simply can't be responsible for interns taking psychedelics on the job.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="character">Z</div>
        <div class="dialogue-Z">Grace, was this guy always this fucking annoying?</div>

        *Grace nods in agreement*

        <br>
        <div class="character">M</div>
        <div class="dialogue-M">Listen, it's really not that serious, you saw me doing some after hours rehearsal, we all do it! It's the crunch!</div>

        <div class="character">G</div>
        <div class="dialogue-G">We don't believe you Marcus.</div>

        <div class="dialogue-Z">You see, upon our arrival, we witnessed a terrifying scene. There in the centre of the Schoolhouse were the likes of Lara Thoms, Eugene Choi, Mish Grigor, Rebecca Jensen, Lilian Steiner and Peter Paltos, worshipping you, bowing from a kneeled position at your feet! Explain yourself!</div>
